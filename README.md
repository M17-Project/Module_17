# Module 17
Welcome to Module 17!

This project provides a standalone _smart microphone_ that transforms any 9600 baud capable transceiver into an [M17](https://m17project.org/) compatible radio. It is based on a STM32F4 microcontroller and is designed to run the [OpenRTX](https://openrtx.org/) firmware. Audio and PTT connectivity is given through a "Kenwood 2 Pin" compatible connector (2.5 and 3.5mm audio jacks).

## Revisions
### Revision 0.1a
This is the initial prototyping revision and not yet designed with "ease of use and enclosing" in mind. Its main purpose is getting OpenRTX up and running on the hardware and providing a proof of concept.

### Future revisions
Future revisions will feature at least additional power supply options and will be designed with an enclosure in mind.

## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by David Rowe's [SM1000](https://www.rowetel.com/wordpress/?p=3125) Codec2 smart mic and shares some of its circuitry. The analog baseband filtering is inspired by the [MMDVM_RPT_Hat](https://github.com/mathisschmieder/MMDVM_RPT_Hat) and is a simplified version of F0DEI's original filter design that is used with great success at many MMDVM repeater sites.

## Enclosure

Module17 revision 1.0 is designed to be compatible with Hammond enclosures (model 1455L801).

### Hardware needed
To use Module17 with the enclosure, you need:
* One Module17 revision 1.0
* One Hammond 1455L801 enclosure (you do not need the sliding plate or the end panels)
* One Module17 HMI board revision 1.0
* One flex 26 pins flex connector (FFC cable, pitch of 0.5mm, connectors thickness of 0.3mm, length of minimum 50mm, edge connectors on the same side)
* One of each side panel PCB
* One 128x64 OLED screen (1.54" diagonal, SSD1309 driver)
* Optional: 8 self-tapping screws with non-tapered head (one standard that might fit is DIN 7500 with size M3.5). This is optional as the screws that came with the enclosure can be used, but the side panels PCBs do not have tapered holes so the fit will not be perfect.

### Assembly instructions
1) First open the enclosure, removing the end panels and removing the sliding plate.
2) Connect the mainboard to the HMI board using the FFC cable: one end of the cable goes in the FFC connector placed below the screen connector, the other end in the FFC connector on the left of the HMI board (when facing the side with the components). The connectors of the cable must face the boards for each connector.
3) Carefully slide the mainboard and the HMI inside the enclosure. The mainboard goes in the lowest position. The HMI board slides at the place where the sliding place removed at step 1 was located.
4) Insert the side panels PCBs inside the plastic bezels that came with the enclosure.
5) Place the side panels on the assembly and screw then in place.
6) Stick the rubber feets that came with the enclosures on the bottom of the assembly.
